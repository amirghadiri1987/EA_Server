Flask File Upload and Row Validation Service
This project provides a Flask-based REST API for handling CSV file uploads, validating row counts, and managing client-specific directories. The API is designed to work with a system that uploads trade transaction files from MQL5 clients.

Features
File Upload and Management:

Files are uploaded to client-specific folders based on the clientID.
The system checks if a file already exists for the client and compares its row count to the given rowSystem.
Row Count Validation:

If the row count of the uploaded file matches the existing file, no changes are made.
If the row counts differ, the new file replaces the existing one.
RESTful Endpoints:

The service provides endpoints for uploading files, checking file status, and validating file data.
Requirements
Server Environment
Python: Version 3.8 or higher
Flask: A Python web framework
Pandas: For reading and validating CSV files
Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
[ ] pip install flask pandas
API Endpoints
1. Root Endpoint
URL: /
Method: GET
Response:
Returns a confirmation message for the server's status.

Example Response:
{
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}

2. Process CSV File
URL: /process_csv
Method: POST

Request Parameters:
Form Data:
clientID: Unique identifier for the client (e.g., 1001).
rowSystem: The expected row count for the file.
file: The CSV file to upload.
Logic:
If the file exists and its row count matches rowSystem:
Responds with a success message.
If the file exists but the row count differs:
Uploads the new file and replaces the old one.
If the file does not exist:
Creates the client folder (if necessary) and uploads the file.
Example Request:

curl -X POST http://<server-ip>:5000/process_csv \
-F "clientID=1001" \
-F "rowSystem=250" \
-F "file=@/path/to/Trade_Transaction.csv"

Example Responses:
File Exists and Matches:

{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "File exists and matches rowSystem",
    "rows": 250,
    "path": "/home/amir/w/ServerUpload/1001/Trade_Transaction.csv"
}

File Exists but Mismatch:

{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "File row count mismatch. New file uploaded.",
    "existing_rows": 200,
    "new_rows": 250,
    "path": "/home/amir/w/ServerUpload/1001/Trade_Transaction.csv"
}
File Did Not Exist:

{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "File did not exist. New file uploaded.",
    "new_rows": 250,
    "path": "/home/amir/w/ServerUpload/1001/Trade_Transaction.csv"
}

Folder Structure
The uploaded files are stored under the UPLOAD_FOLDER directory. Each client has a unique folder named after their clientID.

Example Structure:

/home/amir/w/ServerUpload/
â”œâ”€â”€ 1001/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Trade_Transaction.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ 1002/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Trade_Transaction.csv
Configuration
The UPLOAD_FOLDER is defined in the Flask app configuration. Update the UPLOAD_FOLDER path as needed:

python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/upload/directory'
Additionally, ensure that the upload directory has appropriate write permissions.

Running the Application
Start the Server: Run the Flask app:

python app.py
Access the API:

The server listens on http://0.0.0.0:5000.
Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.
Deployment
For production environments, consider using a WSGI server like gunicorn or deploying with tools like Docker or NGINX.

Example: Run with gunicorn:


gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Troubleshooting
File Not Found Errors: Ensure the UPLOAD_FOLDER directory exists and is writable.
Row Count Mismatches: Confirm the file format is a valid CSV and contains no formatting issues.
Future Improvements
Add authentication to restrict access to the API.
Implement detailed logging for file operations.
Add support for additional file formats.
